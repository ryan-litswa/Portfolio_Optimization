# Portfolio_Optimization
The portfolio consists of five carefully selected stocks: Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Lockheed Martin (LMT). The selection ensures a balance between growth, stability, and diversification across key sectors like Technology, Healthcare, Energy, Consumer Staples, and Defense.

#Justification for Stock Selection:

AAPL (Technology): High-growth potential and market leader in innovation.
JNJ (Healthcare): Defensive stock with stable returns and low correlation to tech.
XOM (Energy): Inflation hedge and exposure to cyclical energy markets.
PG (Consumer Staples): Stability during downturns with reliable dividends.
LMT (Defense): Non-cyclical sector with steady growth from government defence contracts.

#Key Outputs
Optimal Weights:
AAPL: 50%
JNJ: 0%
XOM: 25.86%
PG: 24.14%
LMT: 0%

#Portfolio Analytics:
Expected Annual Return: 19.28%
Portfolio Volatility: 22.94%
Sharpe Ratio: 0.6617

#Conclusions
The optimization heavily favours AAPL (50%), reflecting its high expected returns relative to risk.
XOM (25.86%) and PG (24.14%) contribute to portfolio diversification.
JNJ and LMT are excluded due to suboptimal risk-return trade-offs under the constraints.
However, excluding stocks like JNJ and LMT might indicate overfitting or an extreme focus on short-term risk-return metrics.
